Place a cleaned logo image here to be used by the application.

- Prefer a file named `logo_full.png` (transparent background and no extra white margins). When present, the app will use `logo_full.png` for both the app window icon and in-app logo.
- If `logo_clean.png` is absent, the app will fallback to `logo.png`.


Tips:
- Use a 512x512 square PNG (transparent background) for best results on high-DPI displays.
- Keep the art centered and avoid white/transparent padding around the artwork.
